# DX7SysexReport
DX7SysexReport is a command-line application which can take a Yamaha DX7 sysex file (.syx) and output information about the voices inside the soundbank. 
It is inspired by [DX7Dump](http://tedfelix.com/yamaha-dx7/index.html) by Ted Felix. 

### Basic features
* JSON-format full report (`-v`)
* Detailed information on individual voices/patches with `-p`
* Duplicate voice finder (`-d`)
